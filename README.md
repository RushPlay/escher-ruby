Escher - Emarsys Request Signer
===============================

Ruby implementation of Emarsys' API authentication signing protocol. The status of this authentication method is *work in progress*, you cannot use it in production yet.

The algorithm is based on [Amazon's _AWS Signature Version 4_](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html), but we have customized it for our own needs.

More details will be available at our [documentation site](https://documentation.emarsys.com/).
